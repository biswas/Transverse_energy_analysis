The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory have the ability to collide heavy nuclei, such as those of gold and uranium, at nearly the speed of light, reaching temperatures of trillions of degrees Celcius. These laboratories have provided evidence of the formation of an exotic state of matter, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It only exists for a brief amount of time after such collisions and instantly freezes out into a plethora of new particles, which carry the signatures we can use to deduct QGP properties. It reportedly behaves like an almost perfect quantum fluid with no resistance and exhibits other interesting properties.

One of the methods to probe the properties of this matter is by analyzing the conversion of the beam-direction energy at the time of collision into transverse energy after the collision. This analysis is generally done by using data from the calorimeters placed around the collision site. Under Dr. Christine Nattrass in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Physics (RHIP) group at the University of Tennessee (UT), I am developing C++ codes for a new method to perform the transverse energy analysis by using tracking detectors instead of the conventional calorimeters.

This method involves a manipulation of the transverse momentum spectra, utilizing the mathematical tools pertaining to heavy-ion collision physics, to calculate the transverse energy production. Due to the limited capabilities of the detectors, however, there is a lack of available data points corresponding to low and high momenta. I use the Boltzmann-Gibbs blast wave function to perform a non-linear regression on the available data points and extract the good-fit parameters and other statistics to extrapolate the given spectrum into the low- and high- momentum regions. CERN's ROOT, an object-oriented framework for large-scale data analysis, comes handy in this regard.

- to the above plots, add lambda spectra from STAR Preliminary data on BES strangeness
	1. clearify what "raw" means as opposed to "pT" in one of the directories, 
	 and what cut30 and cut0 mean
	 -> later

Past ToDos and debugging notes:
..................................................................................
	2. DONE --
	modify existing code to read data that is pointwise instead
	 of binned and turn it into TGraphErrors objects instead of TH1D objects
	 2.0 try to read data from all the input files in the directories within
	  a directory recursively -- that did not work, so trying 2.1 (see past 
	  debugging note for why it didn't work) 
	 2.1 copy data from different files into a sinlge file and convert it to
	  almost-original BES data format -- DONE: BES_lambdas.txt 
	 2.2 Turn data in almost-original BES format into TGraphErrors objects
	  in a ROOT TFile object -- DONE: BES_lambdas.root 
	  using BESLambdasToRootFile.cpp
	--> DONE 
	
	3. DONE --
	modify existing code to use the fitting method of the TGraphErrors class
	 instead of the TH1 class
	---> DONE (actually didn't need to use this method after all; constructed bins)
	 3.1 See if the methods (args) in the header need to be modified: DONE
		- yes, they need to me modified
		- spawned file fitSampleSpec_TH_TGE.cpp from fitSampleSpec.cpp
		- From fitBESData5.h spawned fitSpec.h
	 3.2 Add/modify methods in fitSpec.h
		3.2.1 Modify method to estimate integral from data points
		-> alternate solution to use: since the bins are not clear,
			just obtain fitting curves (3.2) for TGraphs mentioned in 3.2.1.1 
			and then use the Integral() method of the TF1 class to
			implement 3.2.1.2
		 - Inside the method getIntegralsAndErrorsFromData:
		 3.2.1.1 create TGraph objects corresponding to:
			3.2.1.1.1 y-values
			3.2.1.1.2 y-value + err
			3.2.1.1.3 y-value - err
		 3.2.1.2 find integrals corresponding to 3.2.1.1.*, then:
			- integral from data points = 3.2.1.1.1
			- integral err+ = 3.2.1.1.2 - 3.2.1.1.1
			- integral err- = 3.2.1.1.1 - 3.2.1.1.3
		3.2.2 Modify method to 
	 3.2 Modify fitSampleSpec.cpp and test on individual spectra
	 	-> file created: fitSampleSpec_TH_TGE.cpp
	 3.3 Modify fitBESData5_1. cpp 

	 
	4. DONE by interpolating -- 
	figure out the correct method to take care of the fact that the lambda 
	 spectra are available for slightly different centralities than the rest
	 of the spectra; specifically, lambda spectra have centralities 40-60 and
	 60-80 instead of 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, and 70-80; guess: combine the
	 relevant centralities in the rest of the data to match lambda
	 centralities; combine what quantities associated with the centralities
	 though? the spectra (in which case, how do the errors add up?) 
	 or the end results (in which case also, how do the errors add up)?
	 -> for quantities k1 and k2 that add up as k = k1 + k2 and have
	  associated uncertainties dk1 and dk2, the uncertainty in k is given
	  by dk = sqrt(dk1^2 + dk2^2)

..................................................................................
3. SCRATH THAT, JUST CONVERT THE GRAPHS TO HISTOGRAMS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE:
	 
	3. SCRATCH THAT, LAMBDAS DON'T CONTRIBUTE THAT MUCH TO THE ET, SO THAT
	MUCH "ACCURACY" IS NOT NECESSARY 
	Convert the TGraphErrors objets to TH1 objects because that's what
		they are supposed to be
		- algorithm: except for i=n, where n is the number of points
		 in the graph, take the mid-point between the ith and the (i+1)th
		 x-values 

..................................................................................

- was trying to recursively read input files from a specified directory using
 gcc's "#include <experimental/filesystem>", but that pointed to errors
 in gcc's header

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/6.4.1/../../../../include/c++/6.4.1/bits/locale_conv.h:33:2: error: 
      unterminated conditional directive
#if __cplusplus < 201103L

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/6.4.1/../../../../include/c++/6.4.1/bits/locale_conv.h:30:2: error: 
      unterminated conditional directive
#ifndef _LOCALE_CONV_H
 ^
 it can probably be fixed by editing the headers by just terminating the
  conditional directives, but instead of doing  that, which might result in
  other problems and consume a lot of time in any case, I'll either just read
  the files one by one by manually customizing the input filename or copy the
  data in the files into one data file in the original BES data format
..................................................................................
- Need to fix the zeroes that appear in integral error calculation in the
following rows in the result:

5	7.7		pi-	3 STATUS=FAILED, CONVERGED with alt par
6	7.7		pi-	4 STATUS=FAILED, CONVERGED with alt par

Strategy 1: analyze individual histograms using 22. fitSampleSpec.cpp
-> problem found: STATUS of minimizing chi-squared for above
histograms = either FAILED or CALL LIMIT, which means the
error matrix is probably problematic in these cases
Strategy 1.1: customize initial fit parameters
- works for some but not all (see comments at the end of each of the data rows above)
- worked for some after changing the maximum number of minimizer function calls to 10000 (default is 1000)
- works for all, now make corresponding changes
in the original fitter code
- some other spectra now giving similar errors.
-> cause: some fitted parameter in each case has unreasonable value/error
- trying to see if customizing parameters helps
27	pi+	6 fixed with alt par
27	ka-	2 "
27	ka+	3 "
27	pba	7 "
39	pi+	8 "
- !!!!!!!!!!Debugged!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Strategy 1.2: use maximum likelihood estimate/cross-validation instead of minimum chi-square
- as elaborated in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3754.pdf, chi-square minimization probably not a good way to fit non-linear models anyway!
- maximum likelihood method did not produce good fits - don't worry about it now, but go back to it later (out of curiosity)
- use chi-squre now since it seems to be working after fixes in Strategy 1.1. It's not good for non-linear models in general, but if it's producing good fits with reasonable values for parameters, use it anyway because the interpretation of the goodness of fit matters only as long as it does not imply unusual extrapolations of the transverse energy. One important way for its validation is comparison of results with past publications, and so far it looks good.
..................................................................................
1. Estimated values of dET/dEta lower than those found in publications
	- However, dET/dEta estimates fairly match those in transverse energy analysis note
Debugged: new estimates in agreement with publication
(39 GeV 0-5% central pi- dET/dETA 76.6687, so that times 5 is around 380,
a ballpark upper limit for total dET/dETA, which from publication, 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06727.pdf#page=25, is 303. Ballpark lower limit
is 76*3, which is around 230, so reasonable.)
..................................................................................
1. BGBW function not producing good fits to pi+ & pi- combined spectrum from:
	http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/ArtSubmission/node/501
	- good fits produced to spectra that are almost the same and available in SPECTRA_COMB_20120709.root
	- the two spectra maily differ in that the latter has some bins in the beginning and at the end with bin content zero, whereas the former does not have those bins altogether
Debug: see if limiting the range of fit to <3 produces similar fits
--> It does not
Hence, the only way the two spectra could have produced such different fits is that the errors are consistently smaller in the former
^ Right! scaled up the errors similarly, and now the fits are good
..................................................................................
-2. ALICE spectra match, but the errors and ETs don't match yet.
Debugged: ETs match within error bars, so they are considered consistent after consultation with Dr. Nattrass.
-1. Around line 102 in ALICE2013DataToRootFile_th1.cpp, trying to check if the j+1 in h->SetBinContent(j+1,binContent[j]) should actually be j.
Debugged: j+1 changed to j, j changed to j-1, loop stop condition changed to j<=binNum, and commented out binEdgesVec.push_back(0.0);
Need to make similar changes to all the codes from the beginning.
Do it with Nathan tomorrow (1/18/2018) so he gets to see what each of the codes does.
Done upto 15. -- DONE

0. pi- and pi+ spectra (ALICE2013Spec_v2_transformed.root) from ALICE 2013 data (31.) lower than those from SPECTRA_COMB_20120709.root as can be compared from 1/13/2018 screenshots (of plots) available in directory debugPlots -- FIXED (errors don't match yet)

..................................................................................
	- available BES data contains d^2N/(2pi*pt*dpt*dy)[(GeV/c)^-2] in pt bins
	- taken care of in fitBESData5.h: Double_t dNdpt_normalized	= 2 * 
		TMath::Pi() * pt * norm * dNdptOverpt+type*0.;
	- need to apply similar transformation in calculating integral from data points
